| **Beholder**                      | Surveillance & Moral Dilemmas: You manage tenants’ activities by installing cameras, intercepting communications, and deciding whom to report.                           | Introduce a “Transparency vs. Confidentiality” system: players must choose whether to reveal private citizen data (e.g., voting records, personal histories) to inform group decisions, risking trust or unlocking critical insights.                                                           |
| **Orwell: Keeping an Eye On You** | Real‐Time Evidence Gathering: You comb through social media, emails, and webcam feeds to build dossiers and make arrest/detention decisions.                             | Implement a “Digital Evidence Panel” mini‐game: players sift through citizens’ public statements (forums, tweets) to identify misinformation or conflicts, deciding which testimonies to present to the Assembly—balancing evidence integrity with privacy concerns.                            |
| **Reigns**                        | Swipe‐Card Decision System: Each choice is distilled into a simple left/right swipe, but choices affect multiple resource meters (e.g., Church, Army, People, Treasury). | Create a “Quick‐Vote” mechanic: during time‐sensitive debates, players present binary proposals (e.g., “Expand funding?” Yes/No), with on‐screen sliders showing how each swipe impacts “Budget,” “Public Trust,” “Environmental Impact,” and “Media Approval.”                                 |
| **This War of Mine**              | Survivor Management & Morality: Players allocate limited resources (food, medicine) among NPCs with differing needs, facing heart-wrenching trade-offs.                  | Add a “Citizen Welfare” resource bar: during deliberations, players must distribute limited “Community Funds” among competing projects (e.g., “Water Purification vs. Food Aid”). Every allocation choice shifts citizens’ emotional states and influences consensus momentum.                  |
| **The Westport Independent**      | Censorship & Editorial Control: As a newspaper editor, you choose which articles to print or censor, influencing public opinion and government response.                 | Integrate a “Media Spin Board”: players decide which citizen testimonies or expert briefs make it to the official Assembly bulletin. Allow selective highlighting or downplaying of statements to steer overall group sentiment, but risk backlash if citizens discover manipulation.           |
| **Not Tonight**                   | Time-Sensitive Decision Queue: As a bouncer, you check IDs against shifting criteria (gender, nationality, status) under increasing pressure.                            | Develop a “Gatekeeper” mini-game: before each Assembly day begins, players process incoming citizen petitions and petitions’ authenticity within a strict time limit. Failing to validate critical petitions results in missing voices at the table, affecting final vote outcomes.             |
| frostpunk                         | Society vs. Resource Tension: You manage a city in an apocalyptic cold, making laws that affect morale, survival, and ideology under limited supplies.                   | Create a “Policy Foundry”: during major Assembly breaks, players draft binding “Laws” (e.g., “Mandatory Recycling,” “Utility Rationing”) that immediately alter resource availability and citizen morale. Each law’s ripple effect changes the next round’s debate priorities and trust levels. |
