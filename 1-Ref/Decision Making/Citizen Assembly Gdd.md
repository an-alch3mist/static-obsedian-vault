**version b:**

write a Game Design Document for a citizen-assembly simulation intended for Steam/Playstore, targeting a broad audience.

Choose ONE crisis theme from: 
	polarization, 
	cost of living, 
	inequality, 
	climate change, 
	technocrats. 
Explain why that theme offers the best mix of gameplay depth and broad appeal. 
The player acts as the Registrar & Enforcer of Assembly(about 50 delegates).

Structure the document with these sections:
1. High-Level Concept (including target audience, genre, tone)
2. Core Gameplay Pillars (screening, debate management, voting, verdict consequences)
3. User Interface Sketches (textual description only)
4. Stage-by-Stage Breakdown (
		Stage 1: Delegate Screening (similar to papers please), 
		Stage 2: Issue Briefing & Debate(a corporate creating fear among reduction in job number if certain actiion were taken even though the action is for wellness of the cause),
		Stage 3: Proposal Drafting & Voting, 
		Stage 4: Implementation Simulation
	)
6. Progression & Replayability (how each new “assembly session” unlocks new tools, scenarios)
7. Leading Moral Voice (how to integrate democracy/equality/human‐rights messaging without being preachy), The outcome? A series of nuanced, realistic recommendations that most often go farther than politicians do - and that truly represent the voice of the population.  

8. Example Playthrough of a Single Game Session (Q&A style, player choices, outcomes)

(note: keep in mind moral voice on democracy, equality and human rights as key elements with morality of choises)

Give the entire response as a plain .txt document, with headings for each major section, and include at least one concrete example per stage.
