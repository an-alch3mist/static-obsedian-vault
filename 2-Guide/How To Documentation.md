What you’re looking at is **FigJam**, Figma’s online whiteboard tool for sketching flow‑charts, mind‑maps, user‑flows, etc., together with some of the built‑in “Widgets” (like Jambot, light bulbs, meeting templates) and the new Shapes menu that lets you drop circles, squares, arrows, connectors and more.

Here’s how to recreate a simple “boxes + arrows” diagram in FigJam—no prior experience needed:

---

## 1. Open or switch to FigJam

1. In your Figma dashboard, click **“New file” ▸ “FigJam file”**
    
2. You’ll land on a blank whiteboard, with a toolbar floating at the bottom.

## 2. Drop down the Shapes & Connectors menu

At the bottom-center of your screen you’ll see a row of icons:

- 🖋️ **Pen**
    
- 📄 **Sticky**
    
- ◯⬛ **Shapes**
    
- ➕ **Widgets & Plugins**
    

Click the **Shapes** icon (◯⬛), and you’ll get a little palette:

- **Circle, square, triangle**
    
- **Arrow**, **Line**, **Connector**
    

_(If you don’t see arrows, hit the “New shapes!” button to reveal all connector types.)_

## 3. Add your shapes

1. Pick **Square** (or Circle) and click once on the board → a shape appears.
    
2. Double‑click inside it to add text (e.g. “Idle”, “Move”, “Attack”, etc.).

## 4. Connect them with arrows

There are two quick ways:

### A. Auto‑connect from a shape

1. **Hover** your mouse over the edge of any shape.
    
2. A little **dot** (handle) will pop up.
    
3. **Click & drag** that dot to another shape → an arrowed line snaps on, and stays “glued” if you move either shape.
    

### B. Manual connector tool

1. From the **Shapes** palette, choose the **Connector** (it looks like a bent line with arrows).
    
2. Click at your start‑point, drag to your end‑point, and release.
    
3. In the top‑right panel you can toggle arrowheads on either end, adjust line‑style (straight, curved, elbow), thickness, dash style, and color.

## 5. Style it up

- **Select** any connector or shape and use the **properties panel** (top‑right) to change colors, line weights, arrowheads, fonts, etc.
    
- Try **Shift+C** to quickly enter the Connector tool by keyboard.

## 6. Bring in stickers & widgets (optional)

If you want a “brainstorm” vibe like in the screenshot:

1. Click the **“+”** at the far right of the bottom toolbar → **Widgets & plugins**.
    
2. Browse “Brainstorm together” or install community plugins like **Jambot**, **Flowchart** or **Diagram** to drop in more fancy widgets.

### Quick shortcut list

|Action|Shortcut|
|---|---|
|Draw a straight line/arrow|**L**|
|Draw a connector (auto mode)|**Shift + C**|
|Select shape tool|**R** (rectangle), **O** (oval)|
|Pan around the board|Spacebar + drag|

That’s all there is to it! Once you get comfortable dropping shapes and dragging connectors, you can whip up complex flows in seconds, collaborate live, and even turn your FigJam board into a clickable prototype in Figma. Have fun jamming!
