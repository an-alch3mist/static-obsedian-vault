provide me a solution to with a custom C# to handle parsing.

farmer was replaced (python style) programming 
in unity from the given input field could you provide a parser that shall execute logic similar to farmer was replaced(for now just debug.log when certain method is executed will do)

provide an example for the behaviour when:
- while loop, 
- if elif else statements 
- variable get, set,
- bitwise operation over number fields 
- prototype variable can be a (integer, string, boolean) get, set etc
(do note that while loop along with a boolean or a method that reurns boolean similar to python
if elif boolean or method that returns boolean or comparision between 2 variables or multiple variable with and, or, not etc) used in python and parsed through C#.


note: the language should is python style (with indentation, : etc, calling or getting functionsetc ),also provide the script in a seperate file.
