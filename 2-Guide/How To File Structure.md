Yes — that layout will work. It’s clear and gives you the ordering you want in Unity. A few small, practical tweaks will make it more robust and easier to maintain as the project grows.

### What’s good about your screenshot

- The numeric prefix forces the exact order you want (Unity sorts by name).
- Folders are logically separated (engine, chess logic, checks, UI/game).
- Filenames match class names (good Unity practice).

### Small improvements I recommend (concise)
1. **Use consistent, scale-friendly prefixes** — prefer `01_`, `02_`, `03_` over `0_`, `1_`.  
    Reason: keeps sorting predictable when you exceed 9 items (`01_...`, `10_...`).
2. **Rename `Checks` → `Tests`** (or `Tests/PlayMode`) if these are automated PlayMode checks.  
    Reason: matches Unity conventions and makes it obvious these are test assets.
3. **Prefer underscores or dashes, not dots** (you already used underscores — good).
4. **Move `UTIL.cs` into a common tools folder** like `01_Common` or `Tools` if it’s shared across modules. Mark it `DO NOT MODIFY` in a README.
5. **Use namespaces** that match folders: e.g. `YourGame.Stockfish`, `YourGame.Chess`, `YourGame.UI`, `YourGame.Tests`.
6. **Avoid overly-generic “Game”/“Manager”** names — prefer `MinimalChessUI` (UI), `ChessGame` or `ChessManager` (game state).
7. **Add small README.md** in each top folder describing responsibility and public API (one or two lines) — very helpful later.
8. **Consider .asmdef files** for `Stockfish` and `Chess` when the project grows (speeds compile times & isolates tests).

### Example final top-level names I’d use

```
01_Stockfish/
  StockfishBridge.cs

02_Chess/
  ChessBoard.cs
  ChessMove.cs
  MoveGenerator.cs
  ChessRules.cs
  ChessManager.cs

03_Tests/          <-- Unity Test Runner friendly
  StockfishBridgeTests.cs
  MoveGeneratorTests.cs
  IntegrationChessFlowTests.cs

04_Game/
  ChessController.cs
  MinimalChessUI.cs
```

### Quick checklist to apply now

-  Rename prefixes to `01_`, `02_`, etc.
-  Rename `Checks` → `Tests` (or `03_Tests`).
-  Move `UTIL.cs` to `01_Common` or `Tools` (and add README).
-  Add namespaces matching folders.
-  Create `README.md` in root of each top folder describing purpose.
-  Optionally add `.asmdef` for `02_Chess` and `01_Stockfish` later.
